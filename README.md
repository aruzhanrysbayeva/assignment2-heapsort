Heap sort 
This project implements the Heap Sort algorithm in Java, along with a performance tracking system that measures execution time, number of comparisons, swaps, and array accesses. 
The results are exported to a CSV file, making it easy to analyze the algorithmâ€™s efficiency and visualize performance trends.
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It has a time complexity of:

Best Case: O(n log n)

Average Case: O(n log n)

Worst Case: O(n log n)

Heap Sort is in-place and not stable.

The second part of assignment is analysis. I analyzed my partner's Shell Sort algorithm.
